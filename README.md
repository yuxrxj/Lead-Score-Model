🚀 Lead Scoring Using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a lead scoring model that predicts the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer. Using Supervised Machine Learning (Logistic Regression), the model analyzes customer attributes and engagement patterns to help businesses prioritize high-intent leads and improve sales efficiency.

The dataset contains multiple customer behavior features such as lead source, website activity, last interaction, and more.

🎯 Objectives

To build a predictive model that classifies leads as Converted (1) or Not Converted (0)

To identify the most influential variables driving conversions

To assist the sales and marketing teams with actionable insights

To suggest decision strategies based on different business scenarios (high recall vs high precision)

🧼 1. Data Cleaning
Removed duplicate records

Handled missing values using imputers

Standardized numerical features

Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot and Ordinal Encoding

Removed identifier columns that do not contribute to prediction

🧠 2. Model Used — Logistic Regression

A supervised classification algorithm, suitable because:

The target variable is binary (Converted = 0/1)

It provides interpretable coefficients

It outputs probability scores ideal for lead ranking

Fast, scalable, and widely used in marketing analytics

⚙️ 3. Preprocessing Steps

Numerical Columns → Median imputation + Standard Scaling

Low-cardinality Categorical Columns → One-Hot Encoding

High-cardinality Categorical Columns → Ordinal Encoding

Combined using ColumnTransformer

Pipeline created for easy training and inference

📊 4. Model Evaluation

Metric	Score

Accuracy	~0.81

Precision	~0.79

Recall	~0.70

F1-Score	~0.74

ROC-AUC	~0.88

Excellent balance between business interpretability and predictive performance.

🔍 5. Key Insights (Feature Importance)

Top variables contributing to lead conversion:

Total Time Spent on Website

Lead Origin: Lead Add Form

Last Activity: Email Opened

These features indicate engagement, intent, and active marketing interaction.

📝 6. Assignment Subjective Questions & Answers

The project also answers 4 business-focused questions, including:

Top converting variables

Most influential categorical features

Strategy during periods with extra interns (high recall)

Strategy when the sales target is achieved early (high precision)

All answers are included as separate PDF files in the repository.
